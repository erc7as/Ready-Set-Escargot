RSE Brainstorming

have one snail that's actually a rock

cutesy, cartoony, yoshi story

keep it lighthearted and wonky, unorthodox

summon a frenchman!
salt bombs
explosive shells
shell tank



snail stats:

				(how easily it can turn)


slime trails - how long?
	power-up changes slime type

shell retraction - how would this mechanic exactly work?



worth checking out kriby airride
	turning or rotation, relative to global
